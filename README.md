# KeyWord_BackUp
This code was written by perl at Linux. The aim is based the KeyWord in main.sh, create backup folder.

Type: perl main.sh $NeedBackupFolder. Then you can see a BACKUP/ folder in $NeedBackupFolder/.

You can change the BACKUP/ to other name by change the $BackName in main.sh.

You can change the Key Word by change the @Key_Words in main.sh.

You can change the maxmun loop number by change the $CountUp in main.sh or set it as very high value to make sure this code can backup all you files.

The $CountUp is to make sure this code won't run all the time if the code is wrong. Also, I am not very sure it won't be wrong, so you need test before.
